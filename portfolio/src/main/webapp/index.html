              <h2>Who am I?</h2>
              <p>I am a go-with-the-flow kind of guy. I enjoy creating things and exploring - which is why one of my favorite hobbies is art and I have a plan to adventrue around the globe.
                  I am a rising sophmore at Occidental College in Los Angeles where I study computer science, mathmatics, and chemistry. I really enjoy video games (my favorites being Destiny and Borderlands 2) and am learning how to be more comfortable in the kitchen.
                  I really like laughing and my biggest goal is to become an excellent communicator. This website is a portfolio of myself to give others some insight into who I am.

            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>My family was built with people from across the globe. My mother was born in the city of Freetown, Sierra Leone, and my father was born in Santiago, Chile. Who you are is partly made of your unchangeable composition of the past, but more so, it is the actions you take in this world that give you definition. The acts of being humane and supportive; not relying on stereotypes and prejudices to define your relationships with people but taking into consideration the conscious decisions they are making and the way they are making a connection. These are the people who are making meaningful contributions to the conversation and one of the ways I’ve found people like this is by reaching beyond my community and going to places that bring people with diverse experiences together.
              </p>
            <p>I am not just my heritage, I am a young man with a goal to have others understand who I am and surround myself with people who will support me and challenge me. Education is what is going to help me achieve understanding, but I believe it is through the process that I will gain the relationships and knowledge that will lead to creating the network of people I strive to be a part of. That’s why I was so excited to go to college: because one of the fundamental functions of college is to bring a many of these kinds of people together. It gives me the ability to actualize my aspirations.

I really enjoy working with pencil, pen, and alcohol markers but I've also started to work with Photoshop and Procreate to try some digital art. The self portrait is the first piece is the first artwork I've created digitally.
